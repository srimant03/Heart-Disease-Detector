# Heart-Disease-Detector
Built a Decision Tree/Random Forest based classifier which predicts the likelihood of a person suffering from heart disease on the basis of a subset of 76 health attributes given in the UC Irvine ML repository. Performed a grid search to obtain the best set of hyperparameters and achieved a highest accuracy score of 85.2% on the test dataset.
